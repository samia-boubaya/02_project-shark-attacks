    "### BRIEF : data analysis of global shark attacks for a business idea\n",
    "You will initially examine the Shark Attack dataset, understanding its structure and formulating a hypothesis or several hypotheses about the data. \n",
    " We hypothesize that shark attacks are more common in certain locations and peak during specific months.\n",
    "We define a Business Case, such as \n",
    "\n",
    "* “As a company that sells medical products, I want to identify destinations with high shark attack rates.”\n",
    "* “As a company providing supply transportation services, I want to know when and where shark attacks peak to plan the safe transport of medical supplies to hospitals.”\n",
    "\n",
    " Throughout the project, we will use Python and the pandas library to apply at least five data cleaning techniques to handle missing values, duplicates, and formatting inconsistencies. After cleaning, we will perform basic exploratory data analysis to validate our hypotheses and extract insights. \n",
    "\n",
    "📝 BUSINESS IDEA — 3 Bullet Points\n",
    "\n",
    "* Problem to Solve: Coastal hospitals and emergency response teams are not always prepared with the right medical supplies during periods of high shark-attack frequency. This business solves the problem by predicting when and where attacks are most likely, so medical supplies can be stocked in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Business Concept: Use historical shark attack data to create global heatmaps and seasonal risk forecasts. Then provide pharmaceutical products (painkillers, antibiotics, blood bags, emergency kits) and transportation support to hospitals and ambulances near high-risk beaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Used to Profit: The business will analyze Country, Date/Month, Gender, Age, Fatality, and Type of Injury to identify high-risk locations, peak attack months, and most common injury types. This allows optimized supply production, targeted sales, and efficient delivery to the areas that need it most.\n",
