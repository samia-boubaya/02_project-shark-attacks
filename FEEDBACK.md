# Feedback

## First iteration

### Good stuff:
- Love the repo folder organization and the names for the interim data files!!! Chapeau!    
- Also love how organized the Jupyter notebook is :heart-eyes:. That's a work of art!  
- Like that you used a GDrive link to make sure you all worked with the same raw data but using the same relative path, i.e. `pd.read_csv("../data/raw.csv")` would have achieved the same result!  

### To fix / improve on:
- Stay consistent with the separators you use in titles, choose either "_" or "-"      
- The file should be `__init___.py` not `init.py`    
- I noticed you did describe the data quite often during the cleaning process, but I didn't see you making any comments on what you were seeing. This is rule #1: Whenever you check something, you need to extract an insight from it, whether it's boring/obvious or not! That's your main job as analysts. Of course, now I ask you to do this everytime in writing so you can build the habit and you might stop doing it for simple things at some point, but for now... it's mandatory!

Tips:
- If you want your bulletpoints to show up in new lines, make sure to add at least 2 spaces after each paragraph
- You can also write `pd.options.display.max_columns = None`         

For next time:
- Try to go for a more suggestive title for the GitHub repository which is connected to your business idea, e.g. Risk Analysis for Travel Health Insurance   
- Use a template for the README file as soon as you create the repository. This way you will be able to edit it / iterate on it as you work on the project. Use Christine Jiang's first video feedback [as a reference](https://youtu.be/UddfFCI70iw?t=1885) for what works.
